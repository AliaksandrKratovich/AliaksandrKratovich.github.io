## ABOUT ME

  I study in the BSU, the Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technologies in the second year. My specialty is Computer Security.I'm a responsible and purposeful student with great desire to develop skills and work in IT sphere. Solving difficult tasks I develop my thinking, imagination and logic. I have no experience in creating real costum projects, but I strive for this. I'm ready to devote much time to get practice creating software. Knowledge about C/C++ helps me to study new systems. I have passed the Epam’s course “C/C++ LEARNING COURSE FOR STUDENTS”. In the future I would like to take part in foreign projects.

**Computer security**. I read various articles and watching videos about the problems of protecting modern computer systems. And my specialty is connected with this. In the future I am going to learn more information about this topic. 

**Travelling**. I get pleasure visiting new places. Usually I travel in different parts of Belarus. 

**Teaching**. In the university I work as a teacher of programming elective for first-year students. We parse academic and my own tasks. It's difficult to work with a big audience. But at the same time it is a good experience for me.
